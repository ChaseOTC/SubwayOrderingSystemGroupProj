## Example Output

## Analysis Steps

The problem asked for the creation of a mock subway ordering system. The user was to
    select a bread size, bread type, meats, cheese, veggies, sauce, and salt and pepper.
    A summary was to be displayed once a button was clicked. 

### Design

We first started by creating the labels, check boxes, radio buttons, buttons, and 
    text area on the form. Once the layout was complete, we then proceeded to had all
    of the event handlers for the two buttons. We then made event handlers for the
    "none" radio buttons. 

### Testing

We first tested the visual of the form. We then made sure that the buttons were working
    correctly and that the text area was displaying the correct output. We then made
    sure the clear button was working correctly. Then we tested the none radio buttons were
    clearing previous selected check boxes or radio buttons of the same type.
